# Standalone Swift Game Engine

This is my (work in progress) no dependency platform independent game engine taking advantage of the new experimental Swift Embedded Mode.

This iteration of my technology was improved for the 2024 GMTK game jam and currently doesn't have a native backend, only wasm.

The only dependency at the moment is for wasm memory allocation https://github.com/wingo/walloc
